## Project Description
Created a customer-facing Experience Cloud website for a fictional company. Used all necessary declarative customization, and created a series of Lightning Web/Aura components to add funtionality to the site. Also created Apex code to provide server-side behavior for the components.

## Technologies Used
* Salesforce
* Lightning Framework
* Experience Cloud
## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development

* Easy creation of cases
* Product price viewing

To-do list:

* Finish the click-and-drag component for adding food to a food stand
* Create an order form to purchase cafeteria equipment
## Getting Started

* Clone this repository
* Using VS Code, install each unlocked package
* Since the Experience Cloud site is not included in the packages, you can build your own using the components
